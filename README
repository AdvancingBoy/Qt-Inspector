Qt Inspector is a tool to browse the object/widget tree of Qt applications.

Qt Inspector starts a specified application or connects to a specified process
and once connected it can:

 - Browse the object tree of Qt applications.
 - View properties of objects
 - Edit properties of objects
 - Locate a widget in the object tree by clicking on it in the application

Building Qt inspector:

	cmake <path to Qt inspector src>
	make -j2

Usage:

 Qt Inspector can either attach to an existing application or launch
 a specified application and then attach to it.

	qtinspector <process ID of running Qt app>
	qtinspector <program name> <args>

Design:

 Qt Inspector operates by injecting a helper library into the target process
 using gdb.  This helper library sets up a local socket and listens for requests
 from the inspector process.  The inspector and target process communicate via
 protocol buffer messages over this socket.
